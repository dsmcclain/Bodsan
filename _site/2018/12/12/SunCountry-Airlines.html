      <p>Dear SunCountry Airlines,</p>

<p>I recently flew roundtrip from Portland to Phoenix on your airline.  I appreciated the graciousness of your employees, and I was satisfied overall with your services. However, there is a problem that I want to bring to your attention.
<!--more--></p>

<p>On my return trip to Portland I flew on one of your 737-800 craft.  On this particular plane, the armrests were different from any other plane I had ridden on. On this plane, the armrests were solid partitions between the seats, and they could not be raised or moved as they typically can be on other airplanes.</p>

<p>There are many types of bodies that do not fit between these solid, unmovable partitions.  Why is it okay with you to provide these accomodations? I have flown on many, many airplanes in my life, all of which seem uncomfortable and unwelcoming to fat bodies, but this airplane was the least welcoming of them all.  Are you okay with that?</p>

<p>The armrests are not very far apart.  I am sitting between them as I type this, and it looks like less than twenty inches.  I am average-sized, so I fit.  Lucky me. What if my hips, butt, or legs are wider than that?  Seriously, imagine this scenario with me.  What are my options? What if I don’t fit? I’m already on the plane.</p>

<p>I would like to hear your response to this problem.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
Dylan</p>

<hr />

<p>I mailed this letter to SunCountry Airlines a few weeks ago.  (Yes, I actually stuffed it in an envelope, put a stamp on it, and sent it through the mail.) My basic assumption here is that <strong>a human being deserves a place to sit that is large enough to fit their body</strong>–even when that human being is with a bunch of other human beings in an enclosed tube that flies through the air.  <em>Especially</em> in that case.  Astronauts might be subject to rigorous physical standards due to the extraordinary demands of their jobs, but civilians who are visiting their retired in-laws should be able to come as they are.</p>

<p>What I found so offensive about this particular flight was the way in which the armrests of the seats created an immovable wall delineating how much space a passenger’s body was allowed to take up.  It was like a little box that each person had to fit into.  For someone with a thin body, there was very little extra room between the partitions.  I fit into the box, but not by much.  Anyone bigger than me would have both hips touching the partitions, a constant reminder of the limits of their alloted space.  Anyone fat simply wouldn’t fit, leaving a painful squeezing and contorting game that would last until the end of the flight.</p>

<p>We are supposed to accept these accomodations. Well, I don’t.  It’s nonsense and it’s not okay.  Just because <em>I</em> fit doesn’t make it okay.  Just because <em>some</em> passengers fit doesn’t make it okay.  Just because you can pay double for a <em>first-class seat</em> doesn’t make it okay. The underlying message is that <strong>we should all fit</strong>, and if you don’t, it’s your fault for having a big body.  What. Ridiculous. Nonsense. And let me be real about this–for years I have flown and ignored this problem because I <strong>do</strong> fit. That’s privilege.  It is so easy to buy in to the nonsense when it benefits you.  That’s my failing.  I already don’t enjoy flying, but I can only imagine how much dread and discomfort I would have to swallow if I were flying and fat.  It’s not okay.  I don’t expect airlines to suddenly start offering seats that fit every type of body–but wouldn’t that world be better than this one?</p>

      It's interesting to note that Sun Country has announced a plan to <a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2018/05/23/sun-country-remodel">end first class</a> on all flights, and is in the process of redesigning their seating.  Stay tuned.
