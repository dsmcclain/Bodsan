Dear LaCroix,

I have been drinking your waters for nearly a decade now. It all started with Pamplemousse.  I loved the flavor and the refreshing zing of the carbonation, and I would buy packs of it at the grocery store as a treat.  Over the years what used to be a treat became a staple in my house, and I often have two or three flavors in my fridge at a given time.

I bought a case of orange the other day, and when I got home I noticed something strange.  Right there on the package, a new message for me: 0 calories, 0 sweetener, 0 sodium = innocent!

I was stunned.

A few days later, I saw a six pack with the following message: "did you know you need to burn 3,500 calories to lose one pound of your body weight?"
