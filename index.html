      ...to have a body. And moral status is not earned by the body. And
      our world is obsessed with evaluating bodies. And our spaces are not
      just unless they are just for every body.

    Important people, movements, and ideas.  They are not contributors to or 
    affiliated with this blog.  They are the ones who have challenged
    what I was taught and what I once believed. They are sources of guidance but also
    sources of confrontation.  They are sources that provoke me to use my own voice.

        My name is Dylan, and I started BODSAN because I was tired of all of the
        nonsense our culture sustains when it comes to bodies.  My own body is white,
        cis, hetero, able, and thin, and as a result I live with many, many layers of
        privilege. I have benefitted, in ways seen and unseen, from the injustices of
        our society and from our culture's obsession with valuing and devaluing bodies.
        My goal with BODSAN is to be a voice of dissent from within this culture, and
        to boost the voices of those who are actively dismantling it, often from
        positions of less privilege than my own.  There is no wrong way to have a body.
        Anything else is just body nonsense.
