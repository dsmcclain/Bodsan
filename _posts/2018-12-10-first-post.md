>Dear SunCountry Airlines,
>
>I recently flew roundtrip from Portland to Phoenix on your airline.  I appreciated the graciousness of your employees, and I was satisfied overall with your services. However, there is a problem that I want to bring to your attention.

On my return trip to Portland I flew on one of your 737-800 craft.  On this particular plane, the armrests were different from any other plane I had ridden on. On this plane, the armrests were solid partitions between the seats, and they could not be raised or moved as they typically can be on other airplanes.

There are many types of bodies that do not fit between these solid, unmovable partitions.  Why is it okay with you to provide these accomodations? I have flown on many, many airplanes in my life, all of which seem uncomfortable and unwelcoming to fat bodies, but this airplane was the least welcoming of them all.  Are you okay with that?

The armrests are not very far apart.  I am sitting between them as I type this, and it looks like less than twenty inches.  I am average-sized, so I fit.  Lucky me. What if my hips, butt, or legs are wider than that?  Seriously, imagine this scenario with me.  What are my options? What if I don't fit? I'm already on the plane.

I would like to hear your response to this problem.

Sincerely,
Dylan



That's the letter I sent to SunCountry Airlines a few weeks ago.
