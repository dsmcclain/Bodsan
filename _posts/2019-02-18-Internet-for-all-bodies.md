And what would that even look like?

I was born in Kansas in 1985.  Even though I had a computer in my home at a young age, I remember a time without one.  I remember when our family got our first one, a Compaq Presario CDS510.  Running Windows 3.1. From Circuit City.  And all I wanted to do was play The Oregon Trail.

I didn't start software development until 2018, almost thirty years later.  Which means I've been at it for less than a year.  I know enough to put this website together (...barely), but I'm still a beginner.  I've learned a handful of programming languages.  I've only just begun to tap in to what's possible.  But one thing I've learned so far, one thing that is so painfully clear, is this: the part of our world that is being built on computers is moving faster, and faster, and faster. The rate of growth Tunnels are being dug, deeper and wider, through the infinite space of the network, and the civilization that is being constructed there is already more complex than most people realize.

In this series I am looking for people and projects that are working to make the internet a space for all bodies.  I want to know what areas need the greatest improvement. I want to see what the obstacles and opportunities are.  And I want to get a better picture of what a world with body sanity would look like.
