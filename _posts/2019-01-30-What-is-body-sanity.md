What is Body Sanity, and why would I make a blog about it? 

I couldn't think of a better voice to provide answers to these questions than the voice of Sonya Renee Taylor.

If you don't know about Sonya Renee Taylor, then you have some catching up to do.  She is a poet who founded the international movement called [The Body Is Not An Apology](https://thebodyisnotanapology.com/).  She is the author of a (fantastic) book by the same name.  Her work and words are spread across many different media, and I highly suggest you [seek her out](https://www.sonyareneetaylor.com/).

One of Sonya Renee Taylor's core ideas is Radical Self Love, and one of her best descriptions of this idea comes from a radio interview she did in September of 2018: 

[Sonya Renee Taylor: radical self-love and accepting every body](https://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/player?audio_id=2018660682). (18 min)

Do yourself a favor and <em><strong>listen to this interview</strong></em>. You'll hear Sonya drive a needle into the thick fabric of slavery, immigration, men's suffering (for real), and neurodivergence, effortlessly drawing the thread of body justice through it all. When I listen to the interview, the connections between racial justice, economic justice, sexual rights, reproductive rights, trans rights, and fat rights all seem so clear.  It's all body justice.

What I appreciate most about Sonya Renee Taylor's voice is how it keeps coming back to the same foundational truths, presenting them with dazzling clarity:

    - Each and every one of us has a body

    - There are so many types of bodies. Size, skin color, sexuality, ability, disability, you name it.

    - Each and every one of us is born with value and worth, regardless of the type of body we inhabit.

THAT is body sanity.  The simple recognition that there is no wrong way to have a body, and the subsequent determination to work against the countless ways our society has chosen to evaluate bodies and attach greater worth and privilege to some bodies over others.  As Sonya explains in the interview, "When we're talking about racism, what we're talking about is, how do we value or not value BODIES. And which bodies have we decided are better bodies." When discussing neurodiversity, she states "as a society, we have decided that brains that don't have depression are better than brains that do. What if we didn't have value judgements put on how peoples brains work?" This is the voice of Body Sanity. My hope is that this blog can amplify that voice, in all its forms, even just a little bit.  So much depends on it.
